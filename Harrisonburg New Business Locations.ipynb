    "\n",
    "#### New businesses are always being created as new ideas for ways to serve the world are generated.  When setting up a new business, it can be challenging where to determine where to set up the physical office or establishment.  Customer quantity is of course one huge factor in the success of a business, so you want your office or business establishment to be close to where many potential customers will see and visit.  Customer stasification is another huge factor to success - people will keep coming back and bring friends if they have an enjoyable and memorable experience - and as a result, discounting the service of your business itself, you will want to be situated in a heart-warming, safe, and fun atmosphere.  Your service could be great, but it could be in a hard-to-reach or otherwise undesirable environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### This is where *location data* comes in.  We have two new business owners: one who is establishing a new restaurant, and one who is establishing a new building contractor firm office.  We will explore where the most ideal places are to set up a new restaurant and a new building contractor firm would be in Harrisonburg, Virginia, as of early-mid 2020."

Likewise, we will want to consider other location factors for a new business, such as: foot traffic, accessibility and parking, image and history of the site, ordinances, and utility/rent/property taxes and such payments."
